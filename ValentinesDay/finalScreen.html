            Happy Valentine's Day my love!! <br><br>

I love you so so so so so sooooo incredibly much baby!! Thank you for saving me from the evil kind lolol <br><br>
There are no words in the English, Danish -- or any dictionary for that matter to even begin to describe how much I love you. Every time I look at you, think of you, or even just hear your voice I have to sit there for a moment, stupid with love, and wonder how I got so incredibly lucky. I genuinely do think Im the luckiest girl in the whole entire world to be dating someone as incredible, amazing, beautiful, strong, silly, kind, loving, handsome, and hardworking as you. <br><br>

(brace yourself, because im going to go off about how much i love you muhahaha)<br><br>

I love your smile, your laugh. I love when you go on tangents about things youre so incredibly passionate about and share your interests with me. I love our silly noises, the random sounds we make that wouldnt make sense to a single person listening in on us. I love how kind and gentle and caring you are. I love cuddling with you, warm and safe in your embrace, hearing your heartbeat and taking in just all of you. I love even the quiet moments, when its just us together, quiet, coexisting. I just love you. <br><br>

I still think back to that moment when I was coming back to Smith from Thanksgiving break and the shooting star went by right over Lee while you were standing in the doorway waiting for me. I dont think theres ever been a clearer sign from the universe that were meant to be forever and ever. Theres no one who I would rather spend the rest of my life with.<br><br>

Its been so incredibly difficult doing this whole long distance thing, but -- like you phrased it on one of our calls -- how lucky am I to have someone to miss so dearly and love despite the distance. We could be 1000s of miles away, or even literally in each others skin, and I would love you no matter what. And that distance will be coming down so, so, so soon! This time next year we might be spending our Valentines Day shopping for apartments to live together in -- Isnt that crazy?? Its difficult right now, but Id do any amount of distance or time so long as it meant I get a lifetime with you. <br><br>

I cant wait to spend the rest of our lives together, babe. I love you so, so, so much -- so much beyond any words humanly possible. MWAAAGHHH!!<br><br>

I love you, I love you, I love youuu!!! <br>~Rachel <33
